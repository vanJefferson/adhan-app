A cross-platform mobile app for prayer times. The simple and intuitive UI makes this app easy for anyone to use. The necessary actions are provided to keep the app lightweight and fast. It is also customizable to suit your preferences.

The app makes use of the [adhan](https://pub.dev/packages/adhan) package.

The app will run on devices with at least Android 4.0.

## Google Play Store
Based on the development process, I would love to publish the app on the Google Play Store in the future for everyone to use.
